# Infinite Trading Protocol 

Welcome to the official code repository for Infinite Trading Protocol. The protocol offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed for advanced financial analysis, data integration, trading bots and messaging functionalities between different networks and protocols. Our codebase extends across various platforms, including dHedge, DeFund, Discord, Yahoo Finance, DexScreener and more, offering a robust toolkit for financial analysts, strategy providers, traders, and developers.

## Introduction

The Infinite Trading Protocol API is designed to provide developers with the tools necessary for creating advanced trading strategies and integrating blockchain technology into their financial applications. The API and Front-end repositories are private, but after the testing and development is complete we will make some components public for transparency. For now, this repository will contain general code that might be useful for traders and strategy providers and the brand-kit with our logos and promotional content.

## Token Utility


The ITP token functions as the utility token for the Infinite Trading Protocol, allowing for the acquisition of API credits.

API Benefits: This API ensures smooth integration with decentralized asset management protocols such as dHEDGE and Enzyme. It grants access to on-chain/off-chain data, price feeds, and quantitative trading data.

The Infinite Trading Protocol is developing an API for strategy providers, quant traders and developers seeking to automate their order executions and on-chain monitoring systems. Users interested in accessing the API without using the protocol's manager, will be required to purchase credits using ITP tokens. Initially, each infinite trading token will credit the trader's wallet with ten credits. 

Our API will empower managers to effortlessly execute diverse algorithmic orders within their vaults, streamlining the creation of indexes, automated strategies, and the maintenance of desired asset allocations within the vaults. All trades will be executed through the users' trading wallets across various protocols and chains. 

The Infinite Trading API will allow users to monitor certain events, receive alerts to Discord/Slack/Google chat, automate orders based on triggering conditions, and access prices data for multiple assets from decentralized and centralized exchanges. Our design goes beyond decentralized finance, and the current trading bots and data fetching capabilities of Infinite Trading Protocol will allow asset managers to execute and automate algorithmic orders for 150+ centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Binance.us, Kraken, Gemini, Kucoin, and others. The goal of the protocol is to serve as a unified interface for a multitude of purposes, including on-chain/off-chain data fetching, multi-chain and multi-platform order execution, algorithmic orders, and more. This single, unified API will provide managers, strategy developers, and other web3 developers a seamless way to interact with different blockchains, protocols, and centralized exchanges.

## Strategy Deployment

Tailored for automated traders, Infinite Trading abstracts back-end complexities, enabling strategy providers to seamlessly deploy across multiple chains and protocols. Strategy providers are granted a unique opportunity to elevate their presence and operations within the decentralized finance landscape through collaboration with the Infinite Trading Protocol. By integrating their strategies within our platform, they gain access to an expansive user base and benefit from the established trust and recognition associated with the Infinite Trading brand. This arrangement not only amplifies their visibility but also positions them to leverage the protocol's reputation to attract and engage a broader audience.

## Incentive Structure

Fee Distribution: To reward their contributions and expertise, strategy providers receive 80% of the management and performance fees generated from their strategies, paid in ITP tokens. This alignment of interests encourages the development of high-quality strategies and supports the providers' growth alongside the protocol.
Operational Advantages: Providers are exempt from purchasing API credits, reducing operational barriers and costs. Their vaults will also be eligible for emissions distribution and may qualify for staking benefits, offering additional avenues for growth and further enhancing their potential yield.
This partnership between the Infinite Trading Protocol and strategy providers fosters a mutually beneficial ecosystem.

## Governance Mechanism


The governance framework of the Infinite Trading Protocol empowers token holders by granting them a direct voice in pivotal decision-making processes. Through a novel mechanism, stakeholders can lock their vault and ITP tokens to mint veITP tokens, which embody their voting rights within the ecosystem.

Governance Features:
Voting Rights: The issuance of veITP tokens to participants who lock in their assets signifies a commitment to the protocol’s future. These tokens grant holders the authority to influence key decisions, ranging from strategic direction to specific operational adjustments.
Enhanced Engagement: This governance model fosters a deeper level of engagement among community members, encouraging a proactive stance in shaping the protocol's evolution. It reflects a commitment to decentralization and collective stewardship, ensuring that the Infinite Trading Protocol remains responsive and aligned with the interests of its diverse stakeholder base.
By refining the roles and incentives for strategy providers and elaborating on the governance mechanism, the Infinite Trading Protocol aims to cultivate a robust, participatory ecosystem. This approach not only accelerates growth and innovation but also ensures that the platform remains at the forefront of the decentralized finance landscape, guided by the collective wisdom and ambition of its community.



## Velodrome strategy

The Infinite Trading Protocol’s DAO plays a pivotal role in maintaining and enhanc-

ing the attractiveness of yields within the Velodrome finance ecosystem. A key strategy

involves actively managing the liquidity pool to ensure competitive yields

and leveraging Velodrome’s unique emissions rewards system. Through strategic brib-

ing, the DAO commits to enhancing the visibility and liquidity of the ITP pool,

thereby securing a more favorable allocation of Velodrome emissions.

## Current Product Status


Our current product boasts a fully functional API tailored for executing trades across more than 150 diverse exchanges, both centralized and decentralized. This API seamlessly integrates with platforms such as dHEDGE and Defund protocol, showcasing its versatility and adaptability. With over a year of successful operation, our track record is exemplified by the robust performance of our vaults within the dHedge ecosystem. Moreover, our infrastructure includes databases, algorithms, and trading bots that are operational and production. Through our v1 API, multiple managers can execute orders efficiently and our algorithms seamlessly integrate with Toros Finance vaults, offering users the flexibility to engage in both long and short positions.
