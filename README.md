## Introduction

The Infinite Trading Protocol API is designed to provide developers with the tools necessary for creating advanced trading strategies and integrating blockchain technology into their financial applications. The API and Front-end repositories are private, but after the testing and development is complete we will make some components public for transparency. For now, this repository will contain general code that might be useful for traders and strategy providers and the brand-kit with our logos and promotional content.
